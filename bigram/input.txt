The Voice can never be like American Idol. #Idol was goofy and cheesy and that was part of it's charm. #IdolFinale
---------
Still a big fan of American Idol❤️💔. #IdolFinale
---------
Can't decide between @kelly_clarkson medley or @JessicaESanchez 'The Prayer' for my fave performance. Both slayed it. #IdolFinale

---------
I want to care about this #IdolFinale but I really really don't.
---------
I'm betting there are some great parties going on tonight in Los Angeles! #IdolFinale
---------
In my view, Cowell's departure from #Idol sent it down a death spiral. Harry Connick Jr. tried to channel his style but failed. #IdolFinale
---------
@ZimeisW They both did so great &amp; we voted (yes, I voted for @laporsharenae) I'm so happy she's getting signed 2! She's a badass #IdolFinale

Trent Harmon just can't seem to sustain high notes. You'd think the tight ass jeans he wears would help him with that. #IdolFinale

The remarkable thing is how many of those contestants have succeeded and to levels like Carrie, Kelly and @IAMJHUD oscar winner #IdolFinale

Why is everyone say "Laporsha should've won" and stuff like that? Trent is an amazing singer who deserved to win!#IdolFinale

Wow! What an amazing final show @AmericanIdol!🎶 Congrats @TrentWHarmon!! You and @laporsharenae are both so talented!❤️ #IdolFinale #idol
---------
Amazing, amazing, amazing!  This one was for you sis, RIP! #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale @AmericanIdol DID ANYONE NOTICE AFTER @RyanSeacrest SAID GOODNIGHT, THE LIGHTS WENT OFF AND HE SAID "FOR NOW" I DIED!
---------
Constant tears. 15 seasons, so many memories, &amp; so many singers I love. I'll miss Januarys with you. #IdolFinale  https://t.co/j4NEzjvzeV

I can't believe America made a mistake on the final season of #IdolFinale
---------
told you💜💜💜 can't wait to hear your music La'Porsha #IdolFinale  https://t.co/dcrRsTLP4v
---------
Wait I missed @Phillips on #IdolFinale? Dangg!!
---------
uhh "FOR NOW"???? I was waiting for Ryan to end the show with "and THIS has been American Idol" what was up with that 😂😂😂 #IdolFinale
---------
Man I'm in the feels about the #IdolFinale but the legacy of the show will go on...because it was the one show tht actually launched careers
---------
I really wanted it to be La'Porsha, but Trent is equally amazing. I said it'd be between the two of them since the beginning. #IdolFinale
---------
When I was little like 4, I would wake up at 4-5 in the morning and turn on that old little box TV and watch American Idol!!! #IdolFinale 😭😭
---------
How did La'Porsha not win? Ugh. Not a fan of Trent. At. All. 🙄😒 #IdolFinale
---------
And also I loved @kelly_clarkson mashup on #IdolFinale.
---------
@laporsharenae &amp; @TrentWHarmon did an amazing job. But I really thought  Laporsha was going to win... CONGRATULATIONS to Trent.. #IdolFinale
---------
@JLo gonna do @JLo and ain't nobody gonna say different. Not even @AmericanIdol #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
#IdolFinale goodbye to my literal favourite show :(

The #IdolFinale was at times awkward, but also exciting, emotional and joyful!  I laughed and cried and danced through the whole thing!
---------

Tonights #VEDA2016 is all about #AmericanIdol and the #IdolFinale Check out the video below: https://t.co/BS26efPL5R
---------
Not a big fan of American Idol, but I watched. Doesn't the loser usually do better than the winner in AI history? #LaPorsha Won  #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol I can't believe this is it...especially with Ryan's cryptic sign off.  #IdolFinale
---------
My Fantasy American Idol team didn't do so well tonight. All my picks were Reuben Studdard. #IdolFinale
---------
Is it a #Scandal that the #IdolFinale happened on #NationalBeerDay? Or, that a #military #veteran #actor used the tags to get more RETWEETS?
---------
He won, hE won, HE Won, HE WoN, HE WON! 😭👏 You deserve it @TrentWHarmon I've been a fan since you auditioned for American Idol. #IdolFinale
---------
@ryanseacrest Congrats on 15 great years! Thanks for entertaining America &amp; always keeping it classy! #IdolFinale @americanidol

---------
So happy for you trent #IdolFinale
---------
I have to say the last episode of American Idol made me tear up just a bit #IdolFinale
---------
My favorite part of the #IdolFinale was when #NickiMinaj delivered a deadpan video message pretending to give a rat's ass.
---------
I'm already missing Idol. #IdolFinale  😂😕😑😟😭
---------
@ThePerezHilton end of an era! #IdolFinale
---------
Goodnight America💙🇺🇸 #IdolFinale

Lowkey think it was rigged from the start. They never record people in open call audition stage but Trent was and the only 1?!? #IdolFinale
---------
Can @AmericanIdol come back already it's been too long #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
I called it!!!! @TrentWHarmon!!!! Ahhhh!!! @AmericanIdol #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell https://t.co/FHBFy5FbhF
---------
#IdolFinale was just a whole bunch of white praising bull crap at its finest 💯 and Carrie Underwood is so overrated. She'll be in Stockton 😡
---------
Its over. I still remember watching this show back on 2002!  #IdolFinale
---------
I was hoping @RyanSeacrest would pull a @IAmSteveHarvey and the winner really be #LaPorshaRenae!😕 Trents great but LaPorsha🔥💯 #IdolFinale

I'd care way more about all presidential elections if there was text message voting and Ryan Seacrest read the results. #IdolFinale
---------
Knowing @ClarkBeckham is in LA and I'm not there has me in tears! I just cried when he started singing! 😭 #IdolFinale
---------
@RyanSeacrest Great way to end it!!! Thank you for all the years! #IdolFinale #willbemissed
---------
Waah I cried. I will miss this show so much. Congrats Trent u deserve d win La Porsha dont worry u have a career too #IdolFinale
---------
The only thing I didn't like was barely any attention to the judges for the past 3 yrs in @HarryConnickJR,  @KeithUrban @jlo #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol Thank you American Idol for great 15 year's of memories #IdolFinale
---------
"For now?!?" You can't make everyone emotional and then be like "oh we kinda lied!" But still tell me what's happening. Please. #IdolFinale
---------
Agree with @TheFienPrint that the #IdolFinale highlighted a key fact: Idol made stars, lots of them. https://t.co/rYnkNbsC4o

@AmericanIdol This was my favorite season of Idol I'm going to miss it.       
 :( #IdolFinale
---------
Watching #IdolFinale with all the big names they have produced over the years and it makes me wonder why anyone does The Voice?
---------
What the #IdolFinale was missing tonight was @VonzellSolomon @leahlabelle @_kimcaldwell &amp; @zealyn &lt;&lt; 4 of my favorite all time finalists
---------
#IdolFinale takes me back to the time when I was licking a Spice Girls lollipop, playing with my Tamagotchi &amp; Justin Guarini lost.
---------
How stinkin cute @kelly_clarkson 👋 #bye #IdolFinale  https://t.co/RaMQBAzCK9
---------
Those idols were really inspiring. #IdolFinale

Seeing @Phillips on the finale, reminded me of the night when I voted for like hours, because I wanted him to win and he did. #IdolFinale
---------
"FOR NOW" #IdolFinale
---------
"Did u watch the #idolfinale" 

Me: https://t.co/jzbQgctUgy
---------
Ryan Seacrest doesn’t have tear-ducts, lbr.  #IdolFinale

Seeing Paula, Randy, Simon(!), and Seacrest reunited might have choked me up a little. Maybe. Shut up. #IdolFinale
---------

---------
@JustinGuarini was so glad to see you on the #idolfinale stage again
---------
@Catiekaparaz Thanks for watching! #IdolFinale

Takeaway from #IdolFinale:  All those great singers can't make a living in the music business but JLo can. #sweetirony @AmericanIdol
---------
@AmericanIdol #IdolFinale Showing why it's the final season.
---------
End of an era - still remember watching the first season of Idol in college &amp; fighting my roommates for the phone to vote... #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol seeing all these tweets i just know i am going to get emotional when i watch it later after work! #IdolFinale
---------
She bangs! William Chung I have no regrets! #IdolFinale

---------
Aw man, I lowkey got a little emotional just now watching the #IdolFinale. Especially when the "She Bangs" guy came out omg...CRYING 😩😂😭😂
---------
The original panel has me emotional #IdolFinale
---------
I'm anti #IdolFinale.  I don't think having someone vote for your success is a substitute for putting in the necessary work yourself.
---------
OMFG!!! END ALREADY  #IdolFinale
---------
No. @JLo is DEF not your mama. Insane performance. #Werkit #IdolFinale
---------
@1Dupdatesscores How are you enjoying it? #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol homecoming, and I have all 14 Idol tour programs. #IdolFinale

I mean, I'm all about the Three Divas, but even more, I'm all about LaToya London. She deserves a bigger career. #IdolFinale
---------
I guessed what Paula would say about the show and about Simon!😂😂😂😂 #idolfinale #farewellidol
---------
I'm confused though because I though LP was stabbed ? #IdolFinale
---------
#HungOnIdol 😂😂😂😂 #IdolFinale @AmericanIdol this was pricelesss!!!!
---------
Where is Adam Lambert?  #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale JLo's dress reminds me of Glinda the Good Witch, and not in a good way. #bigandglittery #peptopink #trashyfromtheblock

@tristanmcintosh didn't get to see u much on the #IdolFinale

American Idol Crowning Moment #IdolFinale https://t.co/EDYwQGsAcx via @youtube
---------
#IdolFinale is everything. 😭💓🙏
---------
#IdolFinale Team LaPorsha was robbed even the judges thought she was going to win but Idol did not want the last idol to b an blk unwed mom
---------
Getting emotional as #IdolFinale comes to an end! It's the end of an era! #americanidolfarewellseason #AmericanIdol
---------
#IfLaPorshaDontWin it's Simons fault 😂😂 #IdolFinale
---------
Trent is really good too but definitely thought La'Porshe was going to win. #IdolFinale
---------
That #IdolFinale was fantastic! Great performances. #AllTheFeels @AmericanIdol @RyanSeacrest #IdolFarewell 😩😍🏆👋🏼👏🏼
---------
I was wondering if/when William Hung was going to appear on the #IdolFinale. #HungOnIdol #SheBangs
---------
Hahaha! William Hung! I miss him! So #funny, indeed! ☺😀😁😅📺🎤🎵🌟 #AmericanIdol #Idol #IdolFinale #WilliamHung #HungOnIdol #comedy @AmericanIdol
---------

---------
Great to see the original judges #IdolFinale
---------
Could have heard more from .@mdoolittle on the #IdolFinale but was still nice to hear her amazing voice! I see she has some moves now lol!

#HungonIdol Hilarious seeing him again! I still remember his audition &amp; subsequent "15 mins of fame"  #IdolFinale #idolfarewell
---------

---------
#IdolFinale SLAYED me. AMAZING show.

---------
Simon Cowell's comeback was rad but Randy didn't even say "dawg" boooo #idolfinale #idol https://t.co/pqCt4BhUPM https://t.co/Gddcs5Yuwi
---------
#LaPorshaRenae will also be joining the Universal Music Group family, signing with 19/Big Machine/Motown Records via @billboard #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale Still can't believe that @JessicaESanchez and @CarlySmithson shared a stage!!! :')
---------
So overall, my most fave seasons are: S5, S7, S10, S11, S14 and S15.

Excluding 1-4 kasi di ko talaga napanood. #IdolFinale @AmericanIdol
---------
I cannot go on with my life right now! #IdolFinale Help! Send @Phillips !!

---------
Where the hell is #JasonCastro and #DavidArchuleta on #AmericanIdol finale??? #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
Uhh... Was Mr. @RJ_Helton at the #IdolFinale? He should have been there... His audition was shown to promote the show before it first aired.
---------
#CryinSeacrest #IdolFarewell #IdolFinale Who.will win? Ah, the wait...!!! @laporsharenae @TrentWHarmon

@kelly_clarkson just watched #idolfinale on my DVR. MAD Props to you maam. I dont know how you held up, but your performance killed!

@KeithUrban What happened?! I mean Trent is good, but @laporsharenae is phenomenal. I'm shocked she didn't win. Totally shocked. #IdolFinale
---------
Totally have a cheesy smile on my face watching all the performances!  #IdolFinale
---------
Great music #IdolFinale!
---------
William Hung busting out She Bangs one last time. This finale is truly everything I hoped it would be. #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol will always be the best show on television, bar none. Thank you for the memories. I will cherish them forever. ❤️ #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale @AmericanIdol I knew they'd bring  @williamhung  out. Lol.. I wonder if the younger fans even know about him?
---------
@SimonCowell is the sweetest.. ❤️ #IdolFinale
---------
They are really just gonna keep moving Sanjaya around the audience and not even acknowledge the poor guy?! #IdolFinale
---------
This #IdolFinale is so cute, and I didn't even watch American idol this season. Great show, so much talent was discovered bc of it :)
---------
Ryan looked slightly petrified when william hung ran out singing she bangs &amp; dancin off beat. 😒 #IdolFinale
---------
@SimonCowell Cant you have a hiatus #IdolFinale going to be missed so much. Well done to everybody  @RyanSeacrest you did good 💜
---------
William Hung is a technical crime analyst now in Los Angeles. He may have to sing "She Bangs" when interviewing criminals. #IdolFinale
---------
My heart exploded when the original judges came out. They will forever be special to Idol!!! #IdolFinale
---------
Almost hated #IdolFinale because I didn't think Simon Cowell was there. At least the GOAT showed up.

---------
Why? Why William Hung? #IdolFinale
---------
YESSS @PiaToscano! Sing it! Such an amazing performance of All By Myself! 👍🏻👍🏻 #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell

I got that had a bad day cd free from work. Forgot all about it until now. Still tired of that song. #IdolFinale

I see #IdolFinale has a sense of humor, giving us the 5 WGWGs, all interchangeable, to do a tribute to a one-of-a-kind artist like Bowie.
---------
Can't believe it's over @AmericanIdol #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell

Everyone on #IdolFinale is singing live except @JLo who is lipsyncing and using autotune. What's up with that?
---------
This show should've ended when Simon left #IdolFinale
---------
I just found out Laporsha didn't win, and I'm so upset I can't sleep. #IdolFinale
---------
No, #IdolFinale, don't remind us of those auditions. They smartly cut those down to nothing after bursting more glass than jet decibels.
---------
Can we PLEASE show Ryan trying to high five a blind guy?!? Favorite moment forever #IdolFinale
---------
Who is that Sexy man in that Blue suit behind @scottborchetta tborchetta #IdolFinale

...and the ultimate slayer, Haley Reinhart?! I could go on. Clearly I'm having trouble saying goodbye. #IdolFinale #MIA (3/3)
---------
I feel like this stage set up with the 5 Idol winners is Beatles-like (&amp; they are performing a Bowie tribute).🖒 #IdolFinale
---------
Honestly I loved David Bowie incredibly but nobody has done an appropriate tribute to him yet. Sorry bout it #IdolFinale
---------
Sooooo Idol ended (FOR NOW!), and I had to write a lil something up on why it was so special to me #IdolFinale https://t.co/NFfiGoI4t5
---------
I know this is like Hollywood week on steroids for all of the idols who were invited to participate 😂😂😂😂 #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
Sleeping through all these shitty song/singer choices with my 60+ parents #IdolFinale  #goodriddance
---------
Uh - there better be more of Cook and Kris... #IdolFinale
---------
Watching @AmericanIdol and @LaToyaLondon was definitely the true winner of Season 3! Believed it then and know it now! #ItsOver #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale The best talent show of all time Thank you! Now there is little chance for talented kids to show their talent without the Idol.
---------
so many old feelings from the #idolfinale 😭

this Bowie tribute is lackluster at best. Mercifully brief. #IdolFinale

Oh My God they really did just put all the white guys with guitars together to rub it in. I thought people were joking. #IdolFinale

Awesome @DavidBowie #tribute. #IdolFinale

A #IdolFinale tribute to David Bowie by the @AmericanIdol  #wgwg....loved it!
---------
It would be more appropriate for #IdolFinale to do a tribute to David Archuleta than David Bowie.
(btw I love Bowie, don't hate me Internet)
---------
So many beautiful boys on the guitar for this Bowie medley. Holla. #IdolFinale
---------
@kelliepickler 👏🏻stand out star on the Idol stage, u go gurl👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 #IdolFinale @CountryMusic @FOXTV @AmericanIdol

Still mad at you @KrisAllen for spoiling the show for me.. But you sure look great. #IdolFinale

LaPorsha didn't win but Jennifer Hudson also didn't win. Idol isn't the end game, we still have plenty of time to see LP win #IdolFinale
---------
I can't wait till I can say I'm going to a @mackenziebourg @DaltonRapattoni or @TrentWHarmon concert like i will probably cry #IdolFinale

Nick Fradiani is so freaking 🔥🔥 #IdolFinale

American idol finale is amazing #IdolFinale
---------
Still exhausted from getting loud with Jennifer Lopez! Can't wait for Vegas! 💕💕 My kids grew up with @AmericanIdol #BitterSweet #IdolFinale
---------
Okay I can't even explain how much I loved Joshua Ledet. He should have won his season. Damn it #IdolFinale
---------
I WANNA SEE THIS JLO IDOL PERFORMANCE!!!! Anyone got link?? #IdolFinale #Jlo
---------

@LaToyaLondon @TaylorHicks  @joshledet SANGGIN'  #IdolFinale #IdolMemories @AmericanIdol Why must this show go away @FOXTV?
---------
That Kelly Clarkson's pre-taped performance of a medley of her songs is 😍😍😍😍 #IdolFinale
---------
Taylor Hicks was NOT qualified age to be on idol with that white azz hair 😂 and why he sound more and more like Michael Bolton? #IdolFinale
---------
Long time no see @joshledet #idolfinale
---------
Why must you apologize  @SimonCowell ? Was expecting to see you back in he judging panel and do what you do best 😏 #IdolFinale #SimonCowell
---------
ZAMN ZADDY #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol pass me the tissue someone #IdolFinale
---------
Holy cow @JessicaESanchez blew it UP on #IdolFinale! #Latina &amp; #AAPI Power!
---------
Taylor Hicks hasn't changed in 10 years. He looks younger now than he did while competing in 2006. "Grease" was good to him. #IdolFinale
---------
MY WHOLE HOUSE WAS TURNT WHEN KELLY PERFORMED #IdolFinale
---------
These are my girls! #IdolFinale #JenniferHudson #FantasiaBerino

Hey! Taylor Hicks! I'll miss his fans sending me mean tweets. #IdolFinale
---------
Thanks for all the memories !#Idolfinale https://t.co/yO8vKqAj5q
---------
. . . But was Corey Clark invited? #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale wow im actually shocked Trent won, not that he didnt deserve it, he is incredible but I really thought Laporsha was going to win
---------
GOOD GOD, WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO TAYLOR HICKS? #IdolFinale
---------
Wooooow Carrie Underwood 👏🙌 #IdolFinale
---------
TAYLOR HICKS!!!!!!

His LIVE gigs....were awesome.

---------
So proud for @TrentWHarmon #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell 15 years WOW..@AmericanIdol
---------
My family has always loved Sanjaya. Seining him tonight was 👌🏻#IdolFinale
---------
When they said @laporsharenae didn't win #IdolFinale https://t.co/7aV7ivhhSg
---------
And Latoya London had better get more attention now, because DAYUM!! #IdolFinale
---------
HERE FOR THIS. #IdolFinale
---------
Why would they pair LaToya London with Taylor Hicks? #IdolFinale
---------
Just Taylor Hicks, George Huff, and Eliot Yamin need to have a number together so I can get my life. #IdolFinale
---------
#HungOnIdol ....best part of the night so far. #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol This is Thee BEST #IdolFinale in The 15 Years #IdolFarewell I Will Miss You Emensley
---------
I don't want to see @AmericanIdol go!!! 😖 #IdolFinale
---------
Why is Constantine in both the rock AND the country medleys? Even as this show dies, it's trying to hurt me. #IdolFinale
---------
Was that #imroyalty by @JeffreeStar on @IAMJHUD ?? 👀💜 @AmericanIdol #idolfinale
---------
Oh no its Joshua Ledet. Show them how that song is supposed to be sang #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol Phenomenal!!  #IdolFinale

---------
Can't wait to see how many followers I lost during the #IdolFinale tonight #sorrynotsorry
---------
The 2nd version of #Chandelier sealed the deal for @TrentWHarmon. Technically great but emotionally profound. That was the key. #IdolFinale
---------
Does #ConstantineMaroulis know this is #IdolFinale? He's been in so many sets you'd think he was auditioning for their full time choir
---------
So glad @thedavidcook plays a guitar.  Spares him the dance routine that the non-guitar dudes had to do! #IdolFinale
---------
Phillip Phillips is so dreaming #americanidolnosony #IdolFinale  the way he sings and plays the guitar ❤
---------
okay but there is no need to continue after @IAMJHUD and @TasiasWord. #IdolFinale
---------
Taylor Hicks is like that dad who thinks he's cool when he isn't, but you still love him anyways #IdolFinale

---------
Thanks for being a fun part of our family for for 15 years American Idol! We'll miss you!! :(  #IdolFinale
---------
@TaylorHicks the best! #IdolFinale
---------
Jlo must not have received the memo. #IdolFinale is about THE IDOLS!  WTF?  Only judge not to sing with anyone from the show. Ridiculous
---------
Taylor Hicks dancing lol #IdolFinale
---------
Can there be an Idol All-Stars and it just be people that should have won or placed higher in their seasons? #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale Idol was dead to me when @adamlambert didn't win.
---------
@JLo 's  performance was EPIC!!! SHE KILLED IT!!!!! 👏👏👏🎤🎵🎶 #IdolFinale
---------
One of the most beautiful voices @JessicaESanchez #IdolFinale

#tbt when Jennifer, Latoya, and Fantasia were the bottom 3 and Jennifer Hudson went home. Now they're back slaying together! 💙 #IdolFinale
---------
I still can't believe that the final episode of @AmericanIdol aired tonight. A big congratulations to @TrentWHarmon! #IdolFinale
---------
@TaylorHicks hottest white haired man out there lol #groovin #idolfinale
---------
Thank you, Fantasia. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 #IdolFinale https://t.co/nRDiOu2UEU
---------
Best thing about #americanidol finale (other than #TrentHarmon winning)? It was all about the music. #idolfinale https://t.co/ZVSUoFShLl
---------
Omigod I can't handle Taylor Hicks dancing and facial expressions 😂😂😂 #IdolFinale
---------
Fantasia is so much better than Jennifer Hudson but didn't get to sing "And I Am Telling You" so no Oscar. Song Choice! #IdolFinale
---------
But, like, what's the point of doing such a big deal out of the #IdolFinale if the show will come back? Oh, ratings, I see... #Obnoxious
---------
15 years!! #IdolFarewell #IdolFinale #americanidolfarewellseason #AmericanIdolFinale  today's is the last episode!!

#IdolFinale #americanidol Taylors still got it. #soulpatrol

---------
MY GIRL LOST TO TRENT THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT RIGHT HERE #IdolFinale
---------
I haven't watch American Idol since Taylor Hicks won... #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
La'Porsha should get Kelly Clarkson as a mentor, and help her pick/write songs. And Kelly can tell her when to say no. #idolfinale
---------
I'll never understand how Taylor Hicks won. Ever. #IdolFinale
---------
Fantasia is still an amazing talent. We're long over accidentally calling her Fantasia Burrito out of Freudian slip. #IdolFinale
---------
I SCREAMED SO LOUD WHEN @joshledet CAME OUT OH MY GOD MY FAV😭😭 #IdolFinale
---------
I've missed seeing Ruben Studdard sweat on National Television #IdolFinale
---------
Guys, I'll name your babies! Whether they are in your wife's womb, or going to be made tonight, I will name them. #name #babies #IdolFinale

And @carrieunderwood and @KeithUrban's performance was killer!! In love!! #KeithUrban #IdolFinale
---------
Trent Harmon 😍😍 #IdolFinale #AmericanIdol #iwillmissit

#IdolFinale JLo looks amazing. BTW why was she not offered the role of Wonder Woman? I think she would've "fit" the costume better.
---------
#AintYourMama #IdolFinale JLo kiiiiiiiiiiillin it as ALWAYS! LOOOOOOOOVE HER! 👠🔊🎼🎙🎶🎵
---------
I'm glad she switched costumes and songs. I like this one, but that "I ain't ya mama" (?) Was making me slightly uncomfortable. #IdolFinale
---------
JLo shakin' her booty to the audience! #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale @RyanSeacrest  said Goodnight America FOR NOW? What does that mean? Is there a next season? maybe in the future?

People misspelling La'Porsha's name when it has been on your tv screen for weeks? #IdolFinale

I don't even want to admit how emotional I got during the #IdolFinale

@carrieunderwood always gives me chills with her voice and that song always makes me tear up.  #IdolFinale

---------
#IdolFinale hell no,can't stand JenniferLopez changing channel.never liked her as a judge.
---------
Trump supporters don't like media telling them who to vote for &amp; apparently #IdolFinale fans don't like judges telling them who should win!
---------
I still think @JessicaESanchez should've won @AmericanIdol Season 11. Too beast at singing "The Prayer." #IdolFarewell #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale I will always love this show congratulations to everyone who had the opportunity to be on it ♡
---------
@AmericanIdol thanks for all the amazing memories watching faves find their voices! From VHS to DVR, Kelly to Scotty to... #IdolFinale

---------
Greatest moment in American Idol history. When @thedavidcook slayed the competition. #IdolFinale https://t.co/rMFjqx4W1T
---------
While I like #TheVoice's format better than #AmericanIdol's, AI has been able to churn out super stars unlike The Voice. #IdolFinale
---------
CONGRATULATIONS @TrentWHarmon !!!!!! #TrentHarmon #AmericanIdol #IdolFinale @AmericanIdol
---------
The #IdolFinale was a great farewell to a show with a lot of highs and lows. I'm going to miss not watching this show anymore. #IdolFarewell

---------
Who won the #IdolFinale ??
---------
we're upset and think la'porsha didn't win bc she's black. she deserved it and EVERYONE voted for her and trent wins? mmmmm... #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale So far this final episode feels like it's going to be Emmy worthy. An epic finale. An epic reunion. An epic goodbye.
---------
But the queen (@laporsharenae) has been signed to Big Machine Records! #IdolFinale https://t.co/re2yaadjiR
---------
@TrentWHarmon @AmericanIdol #IdolFinale OMFG TRENT!!! I'M SO HAPPY!

---------
Other than seeing Kel, gotta say I enjoyed seeing the past contestants... And trying to recognize them! Bo with no hair?!! #IdolFinale
---------
It's interesting to watch the American Idol finale and realize (other than a few stars) how BAD these singers really are. #IdolFinale #fail
---------
#IdolFinale was amazing... Only one thing it was missing!! @CaseyBassy
---------
@KimberleyLocke did you ever get my Aunt Debbie's email? It was in regards to #IdolFinale tickets. She wrote u a letter &amp; sent u a pic of me

---------
OMG! @JLo Diva! #americanidolnosony #IdolFinale
---------
Also I feel like @ETestoneAI11 could have hung with those rocker boys #IdolFinale
---------
The #IdolFinale is reminding me how large the talent pool was there. These people aren't in McDonald's now, and that gives points to TV.
---------
@ElleSatine @kelly_clarkson Kelly has only gotten even more amazing since she won Idol!!  #IdolFinale
---------
So AMAZING @JessicaESanchez #fb #IdolFinale

---------
I have to just say how amazingly well-produced this is. A lot of people and moments to feature, being done very well. #IdolFinale

#SRKPrideOfIndia Guys #AmericanIdol @AmericanIdol is over and 😭😭😭 it's so crazy! #IdolFinale to think that I was a part of it... Wow.
---------
I like the dudes on the Country section much more than the #YouBelongWithMe with them three. #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
Did Kelly Clarkson's cheerleading for La'P help, hurt, or have no effect? I kinda thought it was inappropriate, actually.  #IdolFinale
---------
That moment when you start crying when @kelly_clarkson sings "a moment like" this 15 years later 😭 #IdolFinale
---------
Forgot how stunning Ace's smile was #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
#IdolFinale Just found out @JohnMayer WAS on the exec producer's short list for judges. Bummer, it really should've been done. Imagine that.

So sad they didn’t make Nikki Minaj record her #IdolFinale message WITH Mariah Carey #shade #idol
---------
There have been some really #awesome singers/artists throughout the 15 years #IdolFinale  @AmericanIdol
---------
A moment like this will bring me to tears forever love you @kelly_clarkson #IdolFinale
---------
Ok but really another bluesy white guy singer wins? That's why this show was cancelled #IdolFinale

#IdolFinale Really great finale. All former contestants have really come into their own.  Way to go out!!!

Why are they gassing the other guy like this is a close race against La'Porsha ? #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol  this is the best #IdolFinale  Ever so many amazing performances..
---------
Pretty sure I squealed like a little kid when @dannygokey  and @elliottyamin sang together!!!!!! #IdolFinale #AmericanIdol
---------
Seeing @NikiMinajDaily was the highlight of the show.. Boring! #IdolFinale
---------
And one final plug for Ford. Oh look. A free car. For the finalists. Not the others forced to be in those videos. #IdolFinale
---------
I'm kind of wondering if @NICKIMINAJ had some kind of contractual requirement to record that clearly reluctant farewell message. #IdolFinale

I am disappointed many are turning this into a racial issue. #IdolFinale

Watching the American #IdolFinale. Can't name one finalist this year. Not that I care. Apparently no one else does either, hence its demise.
---------
Goodbye #americanidol !! #philipphilips #kellyclarkson #idolfinale #idolfarewell https://t.co/cs1AEYIDXA

It's only fitting that another mediocre white guy won the last season of Idol. #IdolFinale
---------

---------
TAKE ME BACK TO THE MUDDY WATER
WHERE THE BULL AND THE COW DON'T BOTHER

This is my shit! #IdolFinale
---------
Don't even get me started on Scotty McCreery. Have Mercy! ❤️ #IdolFarewell #IdolFinale

---------
Where's @IAmSteveHarvey #IdolFinale
---------
Country section = The whitest people of Idol #IdolFinale
---------
LOL Nikki's message was so obviously done with zero fucks given. Her PR made her do it to look good. #IdolFinale
---------
William Hung! 😁 #IdolFarewell #IdolFinale
---------
TRENT&amp;LAPORSHA BOTH GETTING RECORD DEALS SO SHUT UP IF YOU STILL BITCHING ABOUT LAPORSHA NOT WINNING #IdolFinale https://t.co/YJmhmOQJHt
---------
@CoachRyanMills with you! Watched all but season 6 because I was still grudging @CHRIS_Daughtry didn't win season 5 #EndOfAnEra #IdolFinale
---------
Where's Fantasia? Clay Aiken? J-Hud? Are they waiting to just pounce? #IdolFinale
---------
What's up with @RyanSeacrest at the END of the #AmericanIdolFinale saying  "Good night America....FOR NOW !"  WTF ?!?  LOL  #IdolFinale
---------
Trent Harmon won #IdolFinale John Cena was there, he was with that bitch NIkki Bella what does he see in her, but hey what can you do lol
---------
@TrentWHarmon won idol because he's talented and more people voted...not because he is white... #IdolFinale #AmericanIdol
---------
@AmericanIdol Two Words -Bad-Ass-  #IdolFinale Lives On Forever #IdolFarewell
---------
It was nice having all the season 10 tweeters back on together tonight. #IdolFinale #Memories
---------
Welp here we go again!! I just hope I don't cry this time😂😭 #IdolFinale
---------
Loved everything about tonight's show. Love that Trent won. I've been his fan since the beginning.  #IdolFinale
---------
Goodbye American Idol. It was a fun few years then the judges got all weird. And the format got stale. But tonight was nostalgic.#IdolFinale
---------
Kelly Clarkson basically gave a 5 minute reminder of how many hits she's had. Just in case anyone dared to forget. #IdolFinale
---------
Forever thanking @AmericanIdol for  @carrieunderwood #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell 😘😘😘😭😭😭😭
---------
#IdolFinale loved Jennifer Hudson
---------
Does Caleb remind anyone else of Foggy from #Daredevil #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
Trent DESERVED it! Get over it! Both he and La'Porsha did, and whoever won, it would've been fair! #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
Nicki so petty for not showing her face at #IdolFinale. She was just in LA last night for Barbershop premiere.
---------
The #IdolFinale was immensely entertaining. Good on them for not bringing in a lot of celebrities. The Idols thru the years were great!
---------
#IdolFinale I thought La'Porsha would/should win, but I won't dis the winner. Trent can sing and he never gave up, kept improving. Respect.
---------
Happiness unites us all! #IdolFinale #inspirationalquotes #inspiration #motivation #faith #bestquotes #happy https://t.co/C34vzIWAZG

Omg this country medley is the cutest thing ever!! I am loving this #IdolFinale so much!
---------
I hate that @AmericanIdol is ending, but this #IdolFinale is so cool!

#RIPAmericanIdol #RIPIdol #AmericanIdol #IdolFinale
---------
I'm cringing so hard already #IdolFinale
---------
I'm really not surprised La'Porsha lost to Trent that show loved white men, but Trent will flop and La'Porsha will flourish #IdolFinale
---------
Brian Dunkleman! It's so nice that they paired the #IdolFinale with #IdolGivesBack.
---------
I think you meant to say, LAST EVER #IdolFinale... "FOR NOW!" https://t.co/3lsKvkPQGS

I love that @BarackObama just intro'ed the @AmericanIdol finale, and took the opportunity to encourage Americans to vote. #IdolFinale
---------
OMG Why Is #Obama opening American #IdolFinale ?!

HE has NOTHING whatsoever to do with the show or voting.

Loser always appearing on shows
---------
@scottborchetta They are BOTH getting record deals? That is GREAT news! Well deserved! @TrentWHarmon @laporsharenae #IdolFinale

#IdolFinale proves this industry isn't based solely on vocal talent.... Just saying
---------
People hating on trent. Whatever. This dude got mad skills too. And so as la porscha.  #IdolFinale
---------
And that's a wrap @AmericanIdol. #IdolFinale
---------
It's crazy. Everyone has always loved La Porsha and she is obviously more talented. I don't even remember the winners name. #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale Don't remember Clay Aikens strong vibrato...

Why La'Porsha lost, her fans got complacent, thinking she would win, we all assumed it,  so they didn't vote hard enough #IdolFinale

So sad none of Mackenzie &amp; Dalton made it to top2... Still, they are the best for me! ♥
@mackenziebourg @DaltonRapattoni

#IdolFinale They both equally deserved it. I would have been happy with either one winning. They were the two from the beginning
---------
This is some bullshit, happy idol is going off air it's all a popularity competition not actual TALENT smh  #IdolFinale
---------
Damn #IdolFinale. Salute La'Porsha...I really thought she would've won. Probably should've gotten Black Twitter involved in the voting.
---------
#IdolFinale 

What if your house or office were 
not attended properly,quite 
messy right? So who is attending the 
#UNIVERSE ?
---------
Best part of the night !!! #IdolFinale  https://t.co/dCacL0mNfs

---------
@AmericanIdol this was a worldwide show, I've watched since I was 5 from Peru, I'm so sad #IdolFinale 😢🎤

I remember when I was in 5th grade &amp; it was the day of the #IdolFinale, I wore a custom tie dye tank top w/ @DavidArchie's face on it #chic
---------
My heart is over joyed!!!  @TrentWHarmon is the #AmericanIdol #IdolFinale
---------
I have many things to say about the #IdolFinale, but most importantly: WHY DOES BUCKY COVINGTON LOOK EXACTLY LIKE HE DID IN 2006?
---------
Replay please 😭 #IdolFinale
---------
Congratulations @TrentWHarmon...I can't wait to hear your album! #youareamazing #IdolFinale 🎤

---------
So happy I actually watched this year! Two of the most talented singers since Carrie Underwood! Both will go far! #IdolFinale

Well thank god, it's doubtful after #IdolFinale finishes taping that it will EVER be re-run and won't pull a reunion appearance later.
---------
Amazing!!!👍 Congratulations @TrentWHarmon  God bless you! #IdolFinale
---------
I relate to Brian Dunkleman #IdolFinale

And I definitely exercised my right to vote for @laporsharenae #idolfinale :U

@laporsharenae God has so many great things in store for you. Trust Him! His plan is always better 😁 #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol united the nation! It will be sorely missed! Thanks for so many great years! #IdolFinale
---------
So I know Trent won and all... but can we talk about Jessica Sanchez? Arguably the best voice to come out of #idol. #idolfinale
---------
@kelly_clarkson sorry I missed you tonight I heard you were wonderful #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol: RETWEET if you want @laporsharenae to win! #IdolFinale https://t.co/fpFm9tQJ40... https://t.co/zd9PAzrrlt

@RyanSeacrest it will be weird only seeing you one night a year now....see you 12/31/16! #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale she's an INCREDIBLE talent, don't get me wrong. But the genre she would most likely do isn't widely popular. Like Fantasia.
---------
@AmericanIdol watching it back now on my recordings with my daughter and her friends!  Epic!
#IdolFinale
---------
Nothing is shocking about him saying "for now". It's not a big twist. It's not a big shock #idolfinale #AmericanIdol

Omg seeing some people on Twitter wondering if the scarf @thedavidcook wore was for Michael Johns...now I'm gonna cry. 😥 #RIP #IdolFinale
---------
Tonight is a huge example of why people stopped tuning in for Idol. #IdolFinale
---------
@BellaTwins @JordinSparks must of been a great Night at #IdolFinale.
---------
#IdolFinale Unless I missed it, one of the best they ever had wasn't on tonight -- Jena Irene
---------
But hey, congrats Trent.  #IdolFinale
---------
This is heartbreaking. I didnt expect that result! But still, congatulations! A blast season! #IdolFinale
---------
@nickfradiani I saw you performed on my TV tonight. You did great. 😊 #IdolFinale
---------
Thank you @mjsbigblog for keeping me company through the years, sneaking quick browses when at work while Idol is on for updates.#IdolFinale
---------
Things that I have realized today: America clearly doesn't know true talent when it's seen. #AmericanIdol #IdolFinale #AmericanIdolFail
---------
Great to see @coltondixon on Idol stage again *-* #IdolFinale
---------
LaPorsha didn't win the #IdolFinale https://t.co/LEYhGiBT7i
---------
Trent deserved the win. They both did. So. #IdolFinale
---------
Now excuse me while I cry uncontrollably because @AmericanIdol is over forever #IdolFinale 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
---------
@AmericanIdol I love @clayaiken's voice!!😍 #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
I thought I was actually gonna stop  crying then I saw the pics of @JLo crying and I lost it all over again. #IdolFinale
---------
Hard to believe it's over. Idol produced so many singers that I became a fan of, like Carrie, Kelly, Kellie and Lauren. #IdolFinale
---------
THIS IS NOT OKAY. I AM INTERNALLY DYING. #IdolFinale
---------
🎊 Still can't get over how amazing the #IdolFinale was! 🎊
---------
#IdolFinale American Idol.....I will miss you so much! @AmericanIdol

#IdolFinale  I'm glad La'Porsche didn't win SHe can have a career with more freedom #PeoplesWinner

Can't believe I just watched the #IdolFinale. It's been so fun to watch for 15 seasons (5 will always be my favorite). Thanks @AmericanIdol!
---------
To the folks who don't think their votes matter politically,exhibit A: #IdolFinale is your metaphor

What Fantasia has is just pure God given talent pure and simple. #IdolFinale

Well I'm not watching season 16 @AmericanIdol! Lol Kidding..if there was a 16 I would still watch..but still I can't believe it. #IdolFinale
---------
How in hell did laporsha not win? I'm beyond confused. Mark my word: She will be more successful then he will ever be.  #IdolFinale
---------
@RadioAmy ALL. THE. FEELS. tonight 💗💗 #IdolFinale

---------
I mean, I wasn't a HUGE fan of La'Porsha either, but Trent winning..goodness, I can only have so many Lays Classic Potato Chips. #IdolFinale
---------
La'Portia should have won the #IdolFinale. Glad she's getting a record deal either way. Congrats to the winner.
---------
"For now." What??? What??? "For now".....That means not right now, but possibly later!😁💜 #IdolFinale @AmericanIdol
---------
Felt all nostalgic watching the #IdolFinale tonight...Been watching since Season 1...What an awesomely orchestrated finale
---------
@TrentWHarmon #IdolFinale Best of luck to you!
---------
You could have given me 100 guesses and I still wouldn't have come up with Bo Bice. #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol A 'winner' lacking humility &amp; gratitude. Didn't thank judges or @RyanSeacrest or American public. #IdolFinale #wrongwinner

---------
Constantine needs to put the damn scarf away. #IdolFinale

The people that are saying Trent shouldn't have won need to stop. Yes, La'Porsha was great but so was he. He deserves it #IdolFinale
---------
BO BICE IS...HOT?! #IdolFinale
---------
la'porsha should have won but Trent did good #IdolFinale
---------
Thank you @SimonCowell for being there at the beginning of @AmericanIdol and for being there at the #IdolFinale !

---------
Can JLo get anymore beautiful? It's like the woman gets hotter with age! #IdolFinale
---------
Thank goodness they didn't force @IAMJHUD to sing #AndIAmTellingYou. #IdolFinale
---------
Gotta say: Haven't watched #AmericanIdol in years, but #IdolFinale was really pretty awesome. I forgot how good some of those folks were.

Congrats @TrentWHarmon amazing talent!!! However will always love @laporsharenae #IdolFinale
---------
Of the remaining 14 "artists", all but one (Kelly Clarkson) saw record sales plummet after their debut. Most times over 50%. #IdolFinale
---------
American Idol started it all.And the rest just follows.Goodbye American Idol! #IdolFinale #aionetc
---------
So many more important things in our community and folks mad about a fucking tv show! Half y'all didn't even vote for her.#IdolFinale
---------
#spoileralert While I believe @laporsharenae was the best she prob will get a better deal out of it. #IdolFinale https://t.co/NfKw57qLTD
---------
Scotty B. choosing the JT song for Trent was a vote&amp;game changer. Without a doubt contributed to the final. Congrats, Trent! #IdolFinale
---------
Thankfull #IdolFinale is tonight. Should've ended season 8.
---------
Now that American Idol is over. Bring back X Factor USA damn it! #IdolFinale #xfactor
---------

---------
Oh my gosh, here's here it gets emotional... #IdolFinale  #IdolFarewell #AMomentLikeThis
---------
Already done walking &amp; taking a nap. Early dinner time in preparation for watching @AmericanIdol finale. :-) #IdolFinale #dinner #earlytime
---------
Unforgettable night! So bitter sweet to say goodbye, but American Idol will live on forever😭💙 #idolfinale @AmericanIdol
---------
#IdolFinale I dunno what to expect. According to myth, any new single from Idol Winners always nukes the No.1 Billy Spot.
---------
@adamlambert where were you tonight?? @AmericanIdol #IdolFinale
---------
This is so sad. I've been watching this show since I was 9 years old. Now, it just says goodbye. The show that started it all. #IdolFinale
---------
UGH THE SONG THAT STARTED IT ALL AND ITS ACAPELLA #AMomentLikeThis @kelly_clarkson #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
Just realized you can hear me say "oh my god" at the end 😂 #IdolFinale @AmericanIdol https://t.co/6erenGo3ri

Goodnight America......For Now #IdolFinale

#IdolFinale Paul would be watching if he wasn't running for his life in Daybreak:Flatlined  https://t.co/szYTb5wHQb
---------
IVE NEVER BEEN SO LET DOWN IN MY LIFE #IdolFinale
---------
So this is how you end a singing competition TV show #IdolFinale  https://t.co/nmB8VgRDwM
---------
People complaining about winner, as they say, did you vote? And if only once, you're an amateur.  #IdolFinale   I know you feel me Archies!
---------
@TrentWHarmon &amp; @laporsharenae need 2 record a duet! With a songwriter like #BrunoMars, it would top the #billboard charts. #IdolFinale
---------
Congrats to both @TrentWHarmon and @laporsharenae!! End of an era!@AmericanIdol #IdolFinale
---------
*New Single* "Ugly" out NOW!!! #cuzeventsrock #idolfinale #newmusic #fantasia  https://t.co/1ThTGFz4ff

Jwu. I missed #IdolFinale 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
---------
#idolfinale is now trending in Belgium https://t.co/4jGKV0Lf5K
---------
@laporsharenae will always be an #AmericanIdol to me!  #IdolFinale
---------
Goosebumps hearing @kelly_clarkson sing "A Moment Like This" #IdolFinale
---------
Steve Harvey where you at?come out on stage like " Sorry, I made a mistake, it says it right on the card La'Porsha Renae" #IdolFinale
---------
I just sang my heart out to a badass pregnant Kelly Clarkson on Idol and I'm not ashamed dammit! #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale Hope everyone who is whining put all the votes they could in for her! In case not, oh well! Both deserving!
---------
Why did @RyanSeacrest say "For Now" after saying "Good Night"? #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
"You know what would be cool? If you let me come audition for the judges" grateful they gave me a shot❤️ #IdolFinale https://t.co/AXDxZfmbDl
---------
#IdolFinale Cmon now! Really?
---------
#IdolFinale La'Porsha seemed sad the whole night - like she knew results - she's gonna be fine. Both finalists were amazing.
---------
Where is Steve Harvey when you need him🙄😒 #IdolFinale
---------
I am still in complete shock of how much Bo Bice has changed! I hardly recognized him! 😳🙊 #IdolFinale
---------
Even if you didn't want Trent to win ,it is incredibly rude to say how shocked u were he won. Let people have their moment #IdolFinale
---------
And congrats to @TrentWHarmon &amp; @laporsharenae both really talented 👏 #AmericanIdol #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell https://t.co/RNXQhOp3JF
---------
OH MY GOSH I STILL LOVE JESSICA SANCHEZ SO MUCH #IdolFinale
---------
I hope this isnt any indication of how the presidential election will turn out! #IdolFinale https://t.co/Z9wywwZ0L9
---------
I guess idol chooses the artist that needs more help because if it was real there was no question La'Porsha won #IdolFinale
---------
Anybody else die at the fact that the pants on the ground guys song a portion😂😂 #IdolFinale
---------
Watching #IdolFinale from DVR, Geezus, how many hits does Kelly Clarkson have? Insane, I'm a metal-head, but always a fan of hers!
---------
@laporsharenae and @TrentWHarmon hold  each other in cutely..they look like a couple to me.
No kidding! #IdolFinale https://t.co/xiMaItpFQk
---------
Big thank you to America for choosing to end American Idol with someone who rightfully deserved the tittle. #IdolFinale
---------
Mono-Man won! #idolfinale @TrentWHarmon congrats.
---------
I saw that the original judges were on the #IdolFinale. Can you imagine Simon's reception in 2016? There would be people protesting "hate".
---------
@TrentWHarmon JUST WON AMERICAN IDOL. NO ONE DESERVES IT MORE THAN YOU🎉🎉🎉#IdolFinale #TeamTrent
---------
All good things must come an end. @AmericanIdol set the platform for the rise and new upcoming artist like Kelly,Fantasia #IdolFinale
---------
I remember when Kelly won. I grew up with this show and I'm crying like a baby right now. A great show bids farewell 💔 #IdolFinale
---------
Pretty good @kelly_clarkson package. It almost makes up for my sadness that she isn't there. At least it's a good reason #IdolFinale
---------
Where was Steve Harvey when they needed him? #IdolFinale
---------
Y'all ain't tell me my boy Larry came back. #PantsOnTheGround #IdolFinale
---------
So Bo Bice cut his hair....he can still rock #idolfinale
---------
#IdolFinale is on... Who is ready to cry 😭😭😭
---------
Can't believe @DavidArchie didn't sing Imagine 😭😭😭😭😭😭 #IdolFinale
---------
CONGRATS TO @TrentWHarmon FOR WINNING AMERICAN IDOL!!!!
#IdolFinale
---------
I'ma have to check Jessica Sanchez out cause ole girl can sang!!! #IdolFinale

---------
Damn, 15 years later, and this song STILL gives me chills. #KellyClarkson #IdolFinale
---------
And really @RyanSeacrest "FOR NOW" the screen goes black then you hear "for now" something is cooking and I want to know #IdolFinale
---------
no matter what i'll always be your fan #TrentWHarmon #IdolFinale
---------
Boatload of talent on #IdolFinale  but #JLo is the only person who had to take her clothes off to show here talent.
---------
Still upset that @laporsharenae didn't won but still proud of @TrentWHarmon over here!!! #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell #aionetc
---------
I can't wait to hear from La'Porsha  #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale would have been complete with at least some words from @adamlambert but I know he is busy making something beautiful for us!
---------
trying not to fight everyone being rude on this hashtag like #IdolFinale https://t.co/tAsr5V1e3r
---------
Did anyone else hear @RyanSeacrest say "...for now." after the show ended?? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?! #IdolFinale @AmericanIdol
---------
Haven't watched #AmericanIdol in years but was fun to see all the contestants from when I did watch! #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale #sweepsteaks i want Carrie's look!
---------
Sometimes you don't need the title or win.. all you need is the platform or the exposure. #PreachGuh #TeamLaPorsha #IdolFinale

---------
To think, if #idol hadn't allowed #trentharmon to sing solo at the group rounds...would be a whole different outcome. #IdolFinale #meanttobe
---------
@greenrose50 @gsherling @PhillipPhever the only thing missing from #IdolFinale was an @Phillips solo!!
---------
Y'all so upset, but they both won imo.. I love them both equally, so I didn't care either way.. Plus La'Porsha got signed too!🔥 #IdolFinale

I hope Trent doesn't turn into a deadbeat winner like the other white males before him. #IdolFinale

Did Ryan hint hint hint about a new show to replace Idol when he signed off?  #IdolFinale
---------
It's amazing how back in the hollywood week he was just the "mono guy" and now he's the last season's winner 😂😄 #IdolFinale

TRENT OMG YES YES YES #IdolFinale

I would like the revamp to be lead by @briandunkleman with mentors Adam L, La Porsha, Katherine McPhee, Daughtry &amp; JHud. #IdolFinale

Like many other seasons, why be surprised when "America gets it wrong"? It doesn't matter who "wins", just ask Chris Daughtry!  #IdolFinale

La'Porsha should have won American Idol. Even the judges were so shocked when they said Trent! #IdolFinale

My only complaint is no @adamlambert 😭💔 #IdolFinale
---------
@RyanSeacrest @AmericanIdol I need answers! Why did you say goodbye only "for now"?
 #IdolFinale #AIonSW #IdolFarewell #GoodbyeForNow

La'Porsha &amp; Trent are both great though. But Piece by Piece is the performance of the season. Followed by Diamonds &amp; Chandelier #IdolFinale
---------
"Good night, America. For now." 😏 #IdolFinale

When they announced Trent Harmon as the #IdolFinale, i changed the channel, turned off the TV, and there the remote.....#LaPorshaRenae

Congratulations @TrentWHarmon! You really have such an amazing voice! 💙💙💙 from your Filipino fans 😄 #idolfinale

I can still hear @PiaToscano singing her heart out #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell

#IdolFinale #ForNow I need answers @RyanSeacrest do tell???

I am still in shock!!!! La Porsha was the clear winner... I just hope America does better election day 2016 #idolfinale la porsha

Congratulations to both La'Porsha and Trent @AmericanIdol #IdolFinale

Sanjaya's wig though!  LOL!  Before the wig, I was already happy he brought back the iconic ponyhawk! #IdolFinale

So happy for Trent Harmon! Nothing but love for La'Porsha!! Wishing both the best!! #IdolFinale

To be real, Trent will be getting dicked around by Idol's label while LaPorsha's album will be released by Sony in like 2hrs. #IdolFinale

it's ok. #americanidol doesn't have a good track record with making their artists successful anyway. laporsha will be just fine #IdolFinale
---------
It's funny how a lot of the runner ups are known more than some of the real idols  #IdolFinale
---------
When @DavidArchie walks on stage at #IdolFinale and I scream like a little girl #fangirl
---------
SOOO excited @TrentWHarmon WON! #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale I have a certain sense of pride in the fact that I've never watched an episode of American Idol. Read a book, watch a film.
---------
I'm afraid the #IdolFinale results are what happens when you think your candidate has "got this"... Then Donald Trump wins
---------
I didn't even think it was close? How did La'Porsha not take that one? Did people forget to vote..you gotta vote people! #IdolFinale
---------
HUGE congrats to @TrentWHarmon for being the last WINNER of @AmericanIdol ever🎉🎉❤️ congrats to @laporsharenae as well😍💜💜 #IdolFinale

Am I the only one that's happy this show is finally over? #IdolFinale

@grass_stains I know, right?!  I didn't even recognize him. #IdolFinale

Truth is, Laporsha has an authentic and out of this world voice, but just having that won't make u excel in this industry. #IdolFinale

#BrianDunkleman makes a classy backstage appearance after #IdolFinale. "It's been a very cathartic evening for me." https://t.co/Y9XWpSU60r

Idol was so lit!! I'm so mad la'porsha didn't win but Trent Harmon was still good I'm gonna miss #Idol #IdolFinale
---------
Thank U @AmericanIdol Its been a wonderful (&amp; sometimes interesting) ride! Springtime TV just won't be the same 😢 #IdolFinale #GoodbyeIdol
---------
@extratv @CHRIS_Daughtry Always stoked to see my fav #AmericanIdol #IdolFinale Will miss @AmericanIdol https://t.co/rKnYJV9z2U
---------
The American Idol finale was epic!  But Haley Reinhart and Adam Lambert, we missed you! @adamlambert  @HaleyReinhart #IdolFinale
---------
@JLo you slayed the performance of #AintYourMama but then again, you always do so i'm not surprised anymore #IdolFinale
---------
Forgot about Casey James. He was good too. #IdolFinale
---------
Been watching American Idol since the beginning. It's weird that it's ending. But that was  a perfect last episode #IdolFinale
---------
I'm very disappointed that @laporsharenae didn't win! She is so talented! I'm positive this is just the beginning of her story! #IdolFinale
---------
Nah. He needs to stop playing. "For now." No. It's done for good. Stop playing games Ryan. #IdolFinale
---------
@wh53 #shebang #IdolFinale #Hungonidol Way to rock William Hung! @Americanidol @Fox
---------
Well the excitement of the #IdolFinale has subsided and all I can think of is my #Heartbreak... my #twinflame is #missingfromme. It hurts.
---------
The #IdolFinale hits harder as an absence because…we'll never see it rerunning or streaming. It only ever did reruns on special occasions
---------
Amazing finale tonight!! So proud of Trent. And I loved that 'Goodnight America ... For now' at the end #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
Congrats to Trent! Sad to see Idol go, but it's had a great run. A lot of great moments throughout the past 15 seasons! #idol #idolfinale
---------
#IdolFinale. Im just going to assume that everyone who's "in their feelings" about the chosen winner actually...voted!!
---------
La'Porsha is the most obvious winner so for a plot twist they let Trent won. 😁 #IdolFinale
---------
@RafizalMUFC  So many memorable idols. I was so honored to be a part of this season and meet them all...they were all amazing #IdolFinale
---------
My 9 year old self who literally idolized Kelly Clarkson &amp; Justin Guarini is crying right now #IdolFinale
---------
@AmericanIdol @TrentWHarmon Congratulations!! Thank you so much #Idol :) #IdolFinale

---------
Thank You American Idol cast and contestants! Even the Audition Fails! So many fun memories. 🖐🏼👏🏽 #IdolFinale
---------

---------

All of you are being so nasty to Trent and saying it was rigid but why is he way higher on iTunes?  #IdolFinale
---------
@Fox26Houston how you gone talk about #IdolFinale And not talk about @IAMJHUD
---------
Trent &amp; LaPorsha represented MS well! #IdolFinale
---------
@JustinGuarini is it bad if the only people I know from this show are you Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood? #IdolFinale
---------
Not really a shocker. I was rooting for La'Porsha but I think Chandelier won it for him. Well done! #IdolFinale  https://t.co/Xz2d99nbK2

I guess some how I jumped over this. #redcarpet dress by #Armaniexchange #AmericanIdol @AmericanIdol #IdolFinale https://t.co/nHCPuD3SlW
---------
I'm honestly so happy for Trent like he may not have been my choice but he's still amazing #IdolFinale
---------
Trent winning over La'Porscha reminds me of Phillip Phillips winning over Jessica Sanchez. Fcking joke #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale congrats #TrentHarmon 🎤💙🎤💜🎤 https://t.co/qdJ0BQZpT2
---------
@AmericanIdol Will miss this show!   awesome finale!So sad 2 see it go but so lucky to have seen it from the very first show!#IdolFinale

What odd choices of Idol Alumni to invite and NOT invite. SMH @americanidol #IdolFinale
---------

#IdolFinale
---------
Remember @IAMJHUD  didn't win but look where she is now! Just wait on it @laporsharenae you going places too!! 💯🎤
#AmericanIdol #IdolFinale
---------
American Idol was full of so many fun memories and music that sounded fantastic.  It made this music nerd's heart happy.#IdolFinale
---------
American Idol ended on a high note. I mean America must have been high to vote for Trent rather than @laporsharenae #IdolFinale
---------
Everybody who is upset that LaPorsha didn't win...did you vote???? smh #IdolFinale
---------
I'm so sad that it's all over 😪💔@AmericanIdol #idolFinale

I'm pretty sure if @laporsharenae won, I wouldn't be so messed up right now. She's the better "bookend" for @kelly_clarkson. #IdolFinale
---------
We love the both of you, @TrentWHarmon and @laporsharenae ! You are both winners to me! @AmericanIdol #IdolFinale
---------
It's hard to say goodbye for the most amazing reality show in the world. American Idol you always in my heart💗 i love you #IdolFinale
---------
I'm crying #IdolFinale 😭😭 @AmericanIdol
---------
Poor @RyanSeacrest now he only has like 14 jobs! #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale JLo needs a new job other than singing.
---------
I'm so glad Hxgwr Zubet beat Q;&amp;:? 'Ale in the last season of American idol. It's 2004 all over again! #IdolFinale
---------
This Latoya, Fantasia, JHud perf is shocking when you remember that 1 night in '04 these women were in the bottom 3 together #IdolFinale
---------
Only saw the #IdolFinale this whole season. I just now saw who else was on this season... I recognized @DaltonRapattoni from #DisneyDudez 😋
---------
Clay Aiken sucked then.... And sucks now 
#IdolFinale
---------
It's been such an emotional week man.Tonight is just the icing on the cake @AmericanIdol I cant believe it's over #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------

Uhm. Hi. @IAMJHUD looks so pretty! #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
@jamiegraceh @SimonCowell that's why @RealRyanSecrest dropped a "for now" at the end but no "secrest out" ???? #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
I see alotta tweets saying y'all wanted La'Porsha to win but did yall even vote?.. #IdolFinale
---------
@RyanSeacrest WHAT DO YOU MEAN "FOR NOW"? 😭 #mixedsignals #IdolFinale
---------
Fuck. My. Life. Trent over La'Porsha??? Wow. He deserves it but I think La'Porsha should've won! #Idol #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell #IdolTop2
---------
#idol going "for now" is like #dwts giving Len a big emo retirement tribute only to have him return 1 season later #AmericanIdol #IdolFinale
---------

@AmericanIdol I can't stop smiling that @TrentWHarmon won!!! Truly deserves it! @laporsharenae amazing job as well!❤️❤️ #IdolFinale
---------
Can't believe Idol is over .. Surreal .. #IdolFinale

---------
Congratulations to @TrentWHarmon for winning American Idol Season 15. You deserved it👏🏼👏🏼❤️ #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
So much hate in #TrentHarmon for what? Laporsha is great on her own she don't need idol, relax #IdolFinale
---------
And that's the end of an era @AmericanIdol #IdolFinale
---------
Trent Harmon won the final season of #AmericanIdol 😊 #trentharmon #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
#IdolFinale  thank God im not an American!!!  It would be embarrassing knowing my people cant choose right!!!
---------
CONGRATS TO MY FAV BOY @TrentWHarmon YOU'RE INCREDIBLE 💗💗 #IdolFinale
---------
Goodbye @AmericanIdol We will miss you! #IdolFinale
---------
LaPorsha prob already has a recording contract lined up anyway, lol! #IdolFinale
---------
I still think @laporsharenae should have won @AmericanIdol  #idolfinale
---------
#IdolFinale For Now??? Uh @RyanSeacrest you got some explaining to do!! 👀
---------
Fox brought back 24, The X-Files, even Prison Break after they ended. You better be live Idol will be back when Fox needs it. #IdolFinale
---------
They brought back #PantsOnTheGround guy. Fantastic. #IdolFinale
---------
Pia slays my life. I can't even with her. My self esteem just plummeted. #IdolFinale
---------
I think laporsha is great but Trent is like a cross between Justin T and Robin Thick. He deserved it.  #IdolFinale
---------
Really @RyanSeacrest... #ForNow! Was this entire @AmericanIdol season all a fake #IdolFinale to get viewers? What do u all think?
---------
I have to watch #IdolFinale of @AmericanIdol . Its what made my teenage years a little bit better #thankyou #AmericanIdol
---------
@JLo I love your performance! #AintYourMama #IdolFinale @AmericanIdol
---------
.. TRENT HARMON is the next AMERICAN IDOL!!!!! &lt;3 #idolFinale &lt;3 Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood &lt;3 #carrieonidol #aionetc
---------
I realize they had to name Trent the winner to give him his fame now; bc clearly LaPorsha about to kill the game, u know JHud?? #IdolFinale
---------
The winners of Idol in my book that got anywhere in the music business are @carrieunderwood &amp; @kelly_clarkson. #IdolFinale
---------
Rock it out Allison!!! #IdolFinale
---------
You should have WON @laporsharenae Sad but I know you will go far! Continue the amazing work! #IdolFinale
---------
I haven't given AF about Idol since Simon left #IdolFinale

---------
Thank you, @AmericanIdol for 15 amazing seasons. We will miss you.. #IdolFinale #IdolFarewell
---------
SO THAT'S IT?!?! NOOOOOO #IdolFinale https://t.co/RAjyMhDfKM
---------
@mjsbigblog should have just made it a three hour show not like @FOXTV has anything better on #IdolFinale
---------
all these seasons yet i barley know any winners. contestants who had the title snatched from them are more known than winners. #IdolFinale
---------
I'm sure La'Porsha will have a great career and be so successful. Trent won't be known a year from now #IdolFinale
---------
#IdolFinale surprises #simoncowell 15 yrs MC classy #ryanseacrest   #Trentharmon wins #CarrieUnderwood 65M records https://t.co/AixVu5ZS5b

Ryan. Did you mean La'Porsha? #IdolFinale https://t.co/CT0FI4TpI4

and please don't make this about race. La Porcha had just as much chance as Trent did, race had nothing to do with the winner #IdolFinale
